# Expo Camera Initialization Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error when working with the Expo Camera API: attempting to use camera functions before the camera is fully initialized. This often results in unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Problem
The code attempts to access and use the camera's `takePictureAsync` method before the camera reference (`cameraRef`) is properly set and the camera is ready. This race condition can lead to errors and crashes.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the camera functions are only called after the camera reference is available and the camera has finished initializing. This is effectively done by using the cameraRef in a conditional statement, making sure the camera is ready before calling any methods.
